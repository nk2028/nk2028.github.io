## Overview

At nk2028, we believe in the power of technology to unlock the mysteries of language and communication. With our expertise in computational linguistics, we strive to build tools that make it easier for researchers, students, and language enthusiasts to access, analyse, and understand our languages.

Our expertise spans a diverse array of linguistic disciplines, but we have gained recognition for our exceptional work in CJKV historical linguistics.
